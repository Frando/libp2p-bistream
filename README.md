# libp2p-bistream

A very simple protocol for [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p) that exposes binary duplex streams.

It works with the usual libp2p stack of transports and muxers, and allows application-level code to work directly on any number of bidirectional streams between peers.

See the [example](examples/minimal/src/main.rs) for a usage example.
